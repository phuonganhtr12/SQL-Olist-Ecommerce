# SQL-Olist-Ecommerce

# Introduction

I investigated the Olist e-commerce dataset from Kaggle to understand its potential for business insights. **PostgreSQL** queries were used to extract data and calculate key performance indicators (KPIs).

# Dataset

The database has 11 datasets containing different information of customers, sellers, orders procedure, etc. Following is the data schema provided by Olist on Kaggle.

# Findings

**1. Customer Growth & Retention:**
   
Olist experienced significant customer growth (765 in Jan-2017 to over 6,000 in Aug-2018). However, customer retention was low (below 3%), which is a concern compared to the industry standard of 20-30% returning customers.

**2. Average Order Value (AOV) & Items per Order:**

No clear trends emerged. AOV stayed between $146 and $169, and items per order remained around 1.1 to 1.15.

**3. On-Time Delivery Performance:**

Olist requires merchants to maintain a 96% on-time delivery rate for the past 30 days. The percentage of qualified merchants initially dropped from Dec-2016 (89%) to Mar-2018 (55%), but Olist managed to recover it to over 80% by Aug-2018.
  
**4. Top Revenue-Generating Product Categories:**

"Health & Beauty," "Watches & Gifts," "Bed, Bath & Table," "Sports & Leisure," and "Computers & Accessories" were the top 5 categories by revenue contribution in 2017 and 2018, representing 37-40% of the platform's total revenue. "Health & Beauty" saw the highest revenue growth (60%) between 2017 and 2018.
